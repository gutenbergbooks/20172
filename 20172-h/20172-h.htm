<span class="sc">Scene</span>: <i>Laboratory in the attic of the Warner cottage.
    At right, toward rear, entrance from down-stairs. A rude partition,
    left, with door in centre. Window centre rear. Large kitchen table
    loaded with apparatus. Shelves, similarly loaded, against wall near
    table, right. Wires strung about. A rude couch, bench, and several
    wooden chairs.</i>
</p>
<p class="scene2">
    <i>Time, about 8 p.m. Lamp burns on table.</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Warner</span> <i>comes
    up-stairs, puts her head inside the room nervously, then enters and
    looks about.</i>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Such a mess! And the doctors will be here in half an hour! (<i>Tries to
get busy but seems bothered. Crosses to table and looks at a little
machine that stands upon it.</i>) <i>That's</i> what's driving my boy crazy! If
I only dared to smash it! The right sort of a mother would do just that!
(<i>Looks at machine with dire meditation.</i>)
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i> (<i>without, roaring up the stairs</i>)
</p>
<p>
Mary Ann!
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>jumps</i>)
</p>
<p>
Yes, Hiram!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i> (<i>entering</i>)
</p>
<p>
Where's Philo?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
In the orchard. I watched my chance, and thought I'd redd up a little.
He won't let me touch anything when he's here.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Just about lives up here, don't he?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Day and night now, since he's been too sick to go to the store. And
I can't have Dr. Bellows bring in that specialist from New York with
things lookin' as if a woman had never come up the stairs. (<i>Dusting
and rattling.</i>)
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Philo's not onto what the doctors are after, is he?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
He thinks they're coming to look at his machine mostly&mdash;and see what's
keepin' him awake nights. But maybe he knows. He's awful sharp.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Sharp? Wish he knew enough to sell eggs and bacon. He's ruinin' my
business. Weighs a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>

                   pound of coffee as if he was asleep. I can see
customers watchin' him out o' the tail o' their eye. They're gettin'
<i>afraid</i> of him! Mary Ann, the boy's going to be a shame to us. He's
crazy!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Don't you call <i>my</i> boy crazy. I won't hear it, Hiram.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
No, you'll wait till the whole village tells you! They're all talkin'
now!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
It's none o' their business!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
It'll be their business if he flies up and hurts somebody.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Philo wouldn't hurt anything alive. He got mad at me once for killin'
a spider.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i> (<i>scornfully</i>)
</p>
<p>
Showed his sense there, didn't he?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
If Philo's queer it's not from my side of the house. You know what your
mother was like&mdash;wanderin' round nights starin' at the stars with that
old spy-glass Captain Barker gave her.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>[6]</span>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
She was a good mother, all the same.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Couldn't cook at all. Your father only kept alive by eating at the
neighbors occasionally&mdash;and as for sewing and mending, you children went
in rags till your Aunt Sary came to live with you.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Mother thought a heap of us, though. I remember how she cried because I
wouldn't go to school and went into the grocery business. And she cried
a lot more when I married you. I couldn't understand her&mdash;<i>then</i>....
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Humph! She'd been shut up fast enough if your father hadn't been the
softest-hearted man alive.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Maybe the boy does take after her, but he's worse'n she ever was.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
She didn't have any books&mdash;or college education&mdash;to turn her head.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Nothing to read but the <i>Weekly Mirror</i>. It was a good paper, though,
all about crops and stock,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span>

                           and what the country people were doing, and
a love story on the inside page. Father subscribed on her account. She
told him her mind had to have <i>something</i> to work on. But she didn't
take to the paper, and he had to read it himself to get his money's
worth.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
A good thing she didn't have a library to get at like Philo. All those
books he brought home didn't do him any good. He began to get queer
about the time he was reading that set of Sir Humphry Davy's Complete
Works, with so much about electrics and the stars, and that sort of
stuff. If we could only get him to quit this studyin' and stay
out-o'-doors....
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
S'pose we clear out this hole&mdash;burn the books, and get rid of all these
confounded wires and jars and fixings. I don't believe he saves a penny
of the wages I give him for helpin' to ruin me. All he makes goes for
this truck. We'll clear it out.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
I've thought of that, but we oughtn't to go too far. They're his anyhow,
and I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, I'm not afraid! And I'll begin with this

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span>

                                               devil! (<i>Pauses over
machine. Starts suddenly.</i>) What's that? He's coming!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>listening</i>)
</p>
<p>
It's only Alice going to her room.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we'd better see what the specialist says first.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
I know Dr. Bellows wants us to send Philo away. But I'm against that,
first and last.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
You wouldn't be if you'd listen to Bellows awhile. You know what he told
me when I met him this morning? "Why, Warner," he says, "I never go to
see the boy without taking a pair of handcuffs in my pocket. It's the
quiet ones that go the wildest when they do break out."
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Hiram, it's not going to be so bad as that. Don't let him set you
against your own flesh and blood. Just let me manage awhile. He needs to
get stirred up about something&mdash;get his mind off this. I wish I hadn't
stopped those letters he was getting from Reba Sloan when she went off
to school two years ago.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
But you said you'd rather see him dead than married to Sloan's girl.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
I meant it, too! But seeing your child dead is not so bad as seeing him
crazy&mdash;and if Reba can save him&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
How in thunder&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
She's a taking girl, Hiram&mdash;since she got back. If Philo gets his mind
fixed on <i>her</i>, she'll soon have him forgettin' this. Why,&mdash;you remember
for three months before we were married you couldn't think o' nothing
but me.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Good Lord! Is that so, Mary Ann?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
I had to hurry up the weddin' to save your business. You were letting
Jabe McKenny take all your trade right under your nose.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Sakes 'a' mighty! If I could come out of a spell like that, there's some
hope for our poor chap.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
That's what I'm telling you!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
But Reba's father&mdash;you going to have old fiddler Sloan in the family?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
He's come into some money now, and any gentleman can take an interest
in music.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
And the mother was that foreign woman.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
But she's dead. It's just as well Philo won't have a mother-in-law.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Reba'll have one, all right. If Philo stays queer it'll be hard on the
girl, won't it?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
He'll not stay queer. If he gets that girl in his head there won't be
room for anything else&mdash;for a while anyway. He'll be worse'n you ever
was. You let me manage it, Hiram.
</p>
<p class="stage">
(<span class="sc">Philo</span> <i>is heard coming up the stairs. They listen in silence

No, my son. I've just put the place to rights a bit. Dr. Seymour is

Yes. (<i>Walks the floor, meditating.</i>)

Man sleeps&mdash;like the rocks, trees, hills&mdash;while all around him, out of
the unseen, beating on blind eyes, deaf ears, numbed brain, sweep the
winds of eternity, the ether waves, the signals from the deeps of space!

</p>
<p class="char">

<p>
Now don't work yourself up, Philo, with the doctor coming. You want to
tell him about your machine.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Philo</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes. He is a great man. He has studied these things. I will talk to him.
He will not laugh.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
Mary Ann, don't you think we'd better bring up some cider? It'll look
more hospitable like.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
That city doctor won't care anything about cider.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Warner</i>
</p>
<p>
My cider's good enough for anybody! And Dr. Bellows'll be sure to ask
for it.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Mrs. W.</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, wait till he does. (<i>Looks uneasily about room.</i>) Don't you think,
son, that if you're going to take to having visitors here I'd better

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>[13]</span>

 move some furniture up? You could have the haircloth sofa&mdash;the springs
are broke anyway&mdash;and Alice says she don't want the wax flowers in the
parlor any more. They're turnin' yellow, but you wouldn't notice it up
here.
</p>
<p class="char">

Do what you like, mother, only don't take anything <i>out</i>. If anything

<span class="sc">Scene</span>: <i>Room in a farmhouse above Siangtan, where the Siang

    beyond which show the tops of pear and peach trees in full bloom.

<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
My lily So Siu, has not the dishonorable color left my wretched cheeks?
Is not my face like the dough before it goes into the oven?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my golden Fe, pearls in the dawn are no fairer!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
But these cow-girl's tatters! Would not my gown of meadow-green mist
with the peach-gold underrobe make me less haggard?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
When your lord, Yu Tai Shun, returns from the hills he will say&mdash;&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[52]</span>

<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, what will he say?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
That the fairies have been your friends. They wove for you this robe of
rose-leaves, and threw over you a gray cloud from the Witch's Mountain.
</p>
<p class="stage">
    (<span class="sc">Wong Fe</span> <i>trips gaily, then with sudden surrender begins to weep.</i>)
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
Have no shame, beloved of miserable So Siu. Water must follow the fire.
I am only a maid, but I know that when the honeymoon is without tears
two pigs have married. Ah, wet my sleeve, my dear one, and not thine
that will lie on the neck of the golden lord, Yu Tai Shun.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
When I awoke this morning the sunlight was on my pillow, but Yu Tai Shun
was gone. All day I have not seen his face. And now the last swallow has
left the sky.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
Why did Prince Ching and the young Japanese choose this day to be guests
of Yu Tai Shun? It is sad for the wife when the friends of her lord find
her alone. Yu Tai Shun will beat his doorstep for not calling him.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[53]</span>
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
He will! Prince Ching is almost his father. May his age climb as the
hills, always nearer the sky!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, you would be sitting alone in a cloud of sighs, not fast wedded
to the bringer of dawn, Yu Tai Shun, if Prince Ching had not won his way
to your brothers, the mighty princes, Wong Li and Wong Sen.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
I kiss his honorable dust! He shall live with my ancestors! And Makuro,
the young Japanese, I shall love him too, for he is most dear to Yu Tai
Shun. Do they still sit in the orchard?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
They have not moved, nor paused in their talking. Do you not hear? Like
bees that cannot choose their flower. It may be that they have brought
news to Yu Tai Shun, and his gloom will pass.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
No, I feel it was their coming, like a far cloud, that shadowed him. Oh,
my So Siu, it will be darker now!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>So Siu</i>
</p>
<p>
I have sent tea and cakes to the orchard.

<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>

It shall not be dark. Do not the fairies of the sun weave a white world
out of the threads of midnight? I will pray to them. We must be merry,
my lily So Siu.

<p class="char">

</p>
<p>
And why not?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Wong Fe</i>
</p>
<p>
I shall dance to-night before Yu Tai Shun. (<i>Tripping.</i>) Is it not good
to have feet? My honorable and glorious mamma weeps when I dance, but it
is because she was born too soon and they crippled her beloved feet.

How glad I am that the old world is gone when only the painted
flower-girls could do the happy things!

Why not, when you seem to have forgotten all that passed between us? I
went from that meeting with an imperishable fire in my heart. I return,

The master said: "Forty centuries has China been content to plough, to
sow, to reap, and with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>[59]</span>

                       her harvest support one-quarter of the human lives
on our planet. Drudgery has been her lot, frugality her virtue. Only so
had she lease of breath. Now she is to unlock her mines, build ships,
and roads of commerce, and with the magic of machinery set her people
free. If that magic is owned by a few, there will be no freedom, but
a slavery whose agony no man can tell. Every owner will be a monarch
greater than the Son of Heaven to whom we bowed. We cannot shut them out
by war. We can do it solely by making China a true democracy where the
people themselves own the magic tools and the great ways to the markets.
To do this is the work of all who love Freedom, and I know no other
goddess." Were these your words, Yu Tai Shun?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Shun</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes ... my words.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Makuro</i>
</p>
<p>
That was five years ago. From all parts of the earth come powers
fulfilling your fear. Leagued with our own purblind princes and dwellers
in the dusk, they hover over China, waiting for war and bribery to
dismember her. And you say your work is done. Yu Tai Shun, where have
you buried my master?

In the heart of the Princess Wong Fe.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Shun</i> (<i>rallying</i>)
</p>
<p>
May we not be too stern in our judgment of the lords of steam and iron?
Lei Kung Sang and the British minister of the So-nan mineral beds have
built houses for the people.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Ching</i>
</p>
<p>
And have taken their land. Men who plucked their own fruit, and took
food from their own gardens, now cannot eat until they have torn new
treasure out of the earth for the kind Briton and the good Lei Kung
Sang.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Shun</i>
</p>
<p>
Their days of work were always long and weary.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Ching</i>
</p>
<p>
But they toiled as free men in the sun, and as free men sang from the
river-boats when the moon rose. In America, where there is still much
land and few people, there are places where children go down into the
mines and never see the sun except on the day they call "holy." How will
it be with China's four hundred millions, when there are not even waste
places where those who would flee may gather? For even her great
untilled spaces are being covered by the foreign hand.

<p class="char">

<p>
Can we not trust a little? In our greatest need, alien hands have
reached out to help us. And we have true hearts among our Chinese
lords. Not all have joined with the invader to herd the people into
slave-yards. Pei Chen-Ping and Sa Yi are most liberal. You, Prince
Ching, and those you gather to you, have hearts like the rising sun. And
the noble princes of the house of Wong&mdash;have they not given me my bride?

It was a Japanese from the Fushun collieries, a Russian prince of the

You had no father, and in my heart you were my son. I spoke for you

a woman.

ignorant enough and brave enough to resist her. <i>That</i> is the America my

meet death alone! You know the poor ghost in the song who died in the
absence of her lover? She is always pleading to be allowed to die again
when his arms may be around her. So would my ghost go wailing if I lost
your kiss in death. (<i>Touches his cheek</i>.) Is that a tear, Yu Tai Shun?
I torture you because I am so happy! You shall laugh, my prince! I know
a new game we shall play. Little So Siu taught it to me to-day. She says
it is an American game. We call it "Guess behind you!" You turn your
back&mdash;like that&mdash;and you must tell me what I am doing. When you miss
three times, then I shall tell you what you must pay. Now&mdash;what is it

I've been here fourteen years, since I was a boy. It ain't a place for
a man. It's too black. You get black outside and inside. Why, they say
your lungs get black from breathing this dust. And your soul gets black.
The place for an honest man to work is out in the white light, on your
ocean or in your woods, or on the roads and railways, and in the big
buildings. This kind of work is work with punishment added to it. A
little of it would be all right for men who go wrong, or for some as
needs discipline. Then some day

                                they'll get machines to do the rest.
Ah&mdash;there's the whistle. Come on, boys, to work again!

<p>
Oh, mother, I went everywhere, and we've brought all who could come!
But there were some in holes in the ground that I couldn't reach, though
we danced and danced, and called and called. They were too far down.
And there were some ill and crippled, in hospitals, that couldn't walk,
and some hidden away in great buildings called factories&mdash;and some in
tenements, where there was no sun, and no green grass to walk on.
Mother, what shall we do? It was so hard to leave them. Won't you go
back with me, and help me?

<p>
She has been dead these thirty days.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
How say you, thirty days! and there is no feature of corruption?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
None. She has the marble signature of death writ in her whole fair
frame. She lies upon her ivory bed, robed in the soft stuffs of Tyre, as
if new-cut from Pentelikon by Phidias, or spread upon the wood by the
magic brush of Zeuxis, seeming as much alive as this, no more, no less.
There is no beat of heart nor slightest heave of breast.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
And have you made the tests of death?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
There is no bleeding to the prick, nor film of breath upon the bronze
mirror. They have had the best of the faculty in Akragas, Gela, and
Syracuse, all save you; and I am sent by the dazed parents to beseech
you to leave for a time the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>[106]</span>

                             affairs of state and the great problems
of philosophy, to essay your ancient skill in this strange mystery of
life in death and death in life.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
I will go with you. Where lies the house?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
Down yonder street of statues, past the Agora, and hard by the new
temple that is building to Olympian Zeus. It is the new house of yellow
sandstone, three stories in height, with the carved balconies and
wrought brazen doors. Pantheia is her name. I lead the way.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
The streets are full to-day and dazzling with color. So many carpets
hang from the windows, and so many banners are flying! So many
white-horsed chariots, and such concourses of dark slaves from every
land in the long African crescent of the midland sea, from the pillars
of Hercules to ferocious Carthage and beyond to the confines of Egypt
and Ph&oelig;nicia! Ah, I remember now! It is a gala day&mdash;the expected
visit of Pindar. I am to dine with him to-morrow at the Trireme. We
moderns are doing more to celebrate his coming than our fathers did for
Æschylus when he was here. I was very young then, but I remember

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>[107]</span>

  running with the other boys after him just to touch his soft gown and
look into his noble face.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
I have several rolls of his plays, that I keep with some new papyri of
Pindar arrived by the last galley from Corinth, in the iron chest inside
my office door, along with some less worthy bags of gold of Tarshish and
coinage of Athens, Sybaris, Panormos, and Syracuse. Ah, here is the
door! It is ajar, and if you will go into the courtyard by the fountain
and seat yourself under the palm-trees and azaleas on yon bench, by the
statue of the nymph, I will go up to announce your coming.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
All is still save for the far, faint step of Akron on the stair, and the
still fainter murmur from the streets. The very goldfish in the fountain
do not stir, and the long line of slaves against the marble wall, save
for their branded foreheads, might be gaunt caryatides hewn in Egyptian
wood or carved in ebony and amber. That gaudy tropic bird scarce ruffles
a feather. What is the difference between life and death? A voice, a
call, some sudden strange or familiar message on old paths, to the
consciousness that lies under that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>[108]</span>

                                   apparent unconsciousness, will waken
all these semblances of inanimation into new life of arms and fins and
wings. Let me try her thus! My grandfather was a pupil of Pythagoras who
had seen many such death-semblances among the peoples of the white
sacred mountains of far India. Ha! Akron beckons. I must follow him.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
Enter yon doorway where the white figure lies resplendent with jewels
that gleam in the morning sun.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
The arm drawn downward by the heavy golden bracelet is cold, yet soft
and yielding like a sleep. The face has the natural ease of slumber, and
not the rigid artificiality of death. 'Tis true there is no pulse, no
beat of heart nor stir of breath, yet neither is there the sombre
grotesqueness of the last pose. But the difference between life and
death is here so small that it is incommensurable, the point of the
mathematicians only. I shall hold this little hand in mine, and, with a
hand upon her forehead, call her by name; for, you know, Akron, one's
name has a power beyond every other word to reach the closed ears of the
imprisoned soul.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>[109]</span>
</p>
<p>
Pantheia! Pantheia! Pantheia! It is dawn. Your father calls you. Your
mother calls you. And I call you and command you. Open your eyes and
behold the sun!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
A miracle, oh, Zeus! The eyelids tremble like flower-petals under the
wind of heaven. Was that a sigh or the swish of wings? Oh, wonder of
wonders! she breathes&mdash;she whispers!
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Pantheia</i>
</p>
<p>
Where am I? Is this death? Some one called my name. That is the pictured
ceiling of my own room. Surely that is Zaldu, my pet slave, with big
drops on her black face.... And father, mother, kneeling either side.
And who are you with rapt face and star-deep eyes, thick hair with
Delphic wreaths, and in purple gown and golden girdle? Are you a god?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
Be tranquil, child, I am no god, only a physician come to heal you. You
have been ill and sleeping a long time.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Pantheia</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I feel weakness, hunger, and thirst. I remember now that I was
well, when suddenly a strange thought came to me on my pillow. I

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>[110]</span>

 thought that I was dead. This took such possession of me that it shut
out every other thought, and being able to think only that one thought,
I must have been dead. It seemed but a moment's time when the spell of
the thought was broken by an alien deep voice from the void of nothing
about me, calling me by name, calling me to wake and see the day. With
that came floods of my own old thoughts, like molten streams from Ætna,
that were rigid as granite before the word was given that loosed them.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
Did you not see new things or new lands or old dead faces, for you have
been gone a month? I am curious to know.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Pantheia</i>
</p>
<p>
How passing strange! No, I saw neither darkness nor light. I heard no
sounds, nor was conscious of any silence. I must have had just the one
thought that I was dead, but I lost consciousness of that thought. I
remember saying good night to Zaldu, and I handed her the quaint doll
from Egypt and bade her care for it. Then the thought seized me, and I
knew no more. My thoughts which had always run so freely before, like a
plashing brook, must have suddenly frozen,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>[111]</span>

                                            as the amber-trader from
the Baltic told me one day the rivers do in his far northern home. Oh,
sir, are you going so soon?
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes, child. You must take nourishment now, and talk no more. But I am
coming again to see you, for I have many earnest questions still to put
regarding this singular adventure.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
Let me walk with you. I will close the great door. Already the gay
streets are silent, and the people crowd this way, whispering awe-struck
together of the deed of wonder you have done this day. You have called
back the dead to life, and they make obeisance to you as you pass, as if
you were in truth a son of the immortals. Your name will go down the
ages linked with the miracle of Pantheia. You are immortal.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
Nay, 'tis not so strange as that, and yet 'tis stranger.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Akron</i>
</p>
<p>
I would know your meaning better.
</p>
<p class="char">
<i>Empedocles</i>
</p>
<p>
The power of a thought, that is the real wonder!

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>[112]</span>

                                                  We just begin to have
glimpses of the effects of the mind upon the body. To me, Akron, the
faculty has set too great store upon herbs and bitter drafts, and
cutting with the knife. I would fain have the soul acknowledged more,
our therapy built on the dual mechanism of mind and substance. For if an
idea can lead to the apparent death of the whole body, so might other
ideas bring about the apparent death of a part of the body, like, for
example, a paralysis of the members, or of the senses of sight, feeling,
hearing; and in truth I have seen such things. Or a thought might give
rise to a pain, or to a feeling of general illness, or to a feeling of
local disorder in some internal organ; and I feel sure I have likewise
met with such instances. And if an idea may produce such ailments, then
a contrary idea implanted by the physician may heal them. I believe this
to be the secret of many of the marvels we see at the temples and
shrines of Æsculapius and of the cures made by the touch of seers and
kings.
</p>
<p>
But this teaching goes much deeper and further. If we could in the
schools implant in our youth ideas which were strong enough, we should
be able to make of them all, each in proportion to his belief

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>[113]</span>

 in himself and his ambition, great men, great generals, thinkers, poets,
a new race of heroes in all lines of human endeavor, who should be able
by their united strength of idea and ideal finally to people the world
with gods.
</p>
<p>
I have among my slaves, who work as vintners and olive-gatherers, a
physician of Thrace, as also a philosopher of the island of Rhodes, a
member of the Pythagorean League. These I bought not long ago from the
Etruscan pirates. Every evening I have them come to me on the roof after
the evening meal, and there under the quiet of the stars we discuss life
and death, the soul and immortality, and all the burning problems of
order, harmony, and number in the universe. What surprises me is that
this Thracian should be so in advance of the physicians of Hellas,
for he holds as I do that the mind should be first considered in the
treatment of most disorders of the body, because of its tremendous
power to force the healing processes, and because sometimes it
actually induces disease and death. And we have talked together of the
incalculable value of faith and enthusiasm so applied in the education
of the child, this new kind of gardening in the budding soul of mankind,
and of what new and august

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>[114]</span>

                            races might thereby come to repeople this
rather unsatisfactory globe.
</p>
<p>
I am minded to free these slaves, indeed all my slaves, and I have the
intention of devoting the most of a considerable fortune, both inherited
and amassed by me, to the spread of these doctrines and to the public
weal, particularly in the matter of planting in the souls of our youth,
not the mere ability to read and write Greek and do sums in arithmetic,
but the seeds of noble ideas that shall make this Trinacria of ours a
still more wonderful human garden than it has been as a granary for the
world's practical needs. From this sea-centre we send our freighted
galleys to Gades in the West, Carthage in the South, Tyre in the East,
and to the red-bearded foresters of the Far North. I would still send on
these same routes this food, but also better food than this, stuff that
should kindle and feed intellectual fires in all the remote places of
the earth.
